# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website that I designed and developed entirely by myself using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The site is simple, fast, and fully responsive, and it serves as a digital introduction to who I am and what I can do.

## 🛠️ Built From Scratch (with some help)

I built this project from the ground up using only **HTML** and **CSS**.  
To accelerate learning and troubleshoot occasional issues, I used **ChatGPT** as a coding assistant.  
All code and design decisions are my own — ChatGPT served as a supportive tool, not a code generator.

## 🎨 Inspired by

I took inspiration from [Oskar Frantti Gleen's website](https://www.oskarfranttiglen.com/) — especially the clean layout and minimalistic aesthetic.  
No code was copied; everything was recreated independently for learning and practice purposes.

## 🧩 Sections

The website includes the following sections:

- **About Me** – a short introduction and personal background  
- **Profile** – key personal details and characteristics  
- **Education** – academic history  
- **Skills** – list of my core competencies  
- **Projects** – selected personal or academic projects

## 🎯 Goals

This project helped me:

- Improve my understanding of HTML/CSS layout and structure  
- Practice semantic HTML and clean, accessible design  
- Develop a consistent visual style without relying on frameworks  
- Build a presentable online portfolio from scratch
